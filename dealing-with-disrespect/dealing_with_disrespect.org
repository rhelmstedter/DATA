* The Problem
There is a consensus that disrespectful behavior exhibited by students has reached an unacceptable level. We are defining disrespect as deliberate action such as walking away, defying, or talking back to a reasonable request from any adult on campus. While we agree that there are other important issues, this is the principle non-negotiable issue we are facing. Teachers have committed to focusing on this one issue above all others. We need to reset the current narrative by coming out in full force and presenting a united front. The solution to this problem is twofold:
1. Educate
2. Enforce Consequences
* Solutions
** Educate
We are educators and this is what we do best. We need to teach students what constitutes disrespectful behavior and that will not be allowed at this school. Teachers have committed to creating slides that show clear examples of disrespect. These slides are to be pushed out in homeroom. When appropriate, all staff members need to identify disrespectful behavior and explain to students why it is disrespectful.
** Consequences
Teachers have agreed that any student who exhibits disrespect to any adult on campus will serve a lunch detention. There will be an initial 2-week implementation where teachers will volunteer to host detention in their classrooms. There will be no clubs during these two weeks since teachers will be hosting detention. Lunch detentions will consist of no more than 5 students per room. While serving a lunch detention, student use of electronic devices is prohibited. Furthermore, students are to complete a /staff apology letter/. This letter will provide students an opportunity to reflect on their behavior. If the letter is not completed, students will be assigned additional detentions until the completion of the letter.
** Scope
In order for this campaign to be successful, it is crucial that our focus remains narrow and all staff members work to de-escalate situations when possible. Lunch detentions may only be assigned for disrespectful behavior. Behavior outside the scope of disrespect includes, but is not limited to: dress code violations, cell phone use, tardies, missing assignments, or academic infractions. Behavior outside the scope of disrespect must be addressed in another fashion.

If teachers need further support with broader classroom management, Mike Robinson has offered support for implementing CHAMPS.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Recess Restriction*

Teachers may restrict a student's recess time only when they believe that this action is the most effective way to bring about improved behavior. When recess restriction involves the withholding of physical activity from a student, teachers shall try other disciplinary measures before imposing the restriction. Recess restriction shall be subject to the following conditions:

#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment itemize*
#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [noitemsep]
1. The student shall be given adequate time to use the restroom and get a drink or eat lunch, as appropriate.
2. The student shall remain under a certificated employee's supervision during the period of restriction.
3. The student's teacher shall inform the principal of any recess restrictions imposed.
#+END_QUOTE

Helmstedter's interpretation is that we are *not required* to notify parents of a lunch time detention. However, it is important to involve the parents if we wish to make a difference. As the monitor teacher, Helmstedter will work with admin to get access and send out the parent email.

This is a single slide with CHAMPS expectations

The was a debrief during the staff meeting <2023-03-15 Wed>. Anecdotally, staff mentioned that interactions with students have changed for the better. While addressing areas of improvement, staff agreed to the following. First, when a student is assigned to a host teacher please notify that teacher. Second, we also trying to be aware of breaking up friend groups in order to manage detention sessions. Hosts may negotiate swapping the rooms in which students serve in order to manage this. Both of these must happen on the day before the detention is served to ensure the call slips and meals are delivered to the correct location.
