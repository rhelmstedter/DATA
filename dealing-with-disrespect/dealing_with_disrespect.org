* The Problem
There is a consensus that disrespectful behavior exhibited by students has reached an unacceptable level. We are defining disrespect as deliberate action such as walking away, defying, or talking back to a reasonable request from any adult on campus. While we agree that there are other important issues, this is the principle non-negotiable issue we are facing. Teachers have committed to focusing on this one issue above all others. We need to reset the current narrative by coming out in full force and presenting a united front. The solution to this problem is twofold:
1. Educate
2. Enforce Consequences
* Solutions
** Educate
We are educators and this is what we do best. We need to teach students what constitutes disrespectful behavior and that it will not be allowed at this school. Teachers have committed to creating slides that show clear examples of disrespect. These slides are to be pushed out in homeroom. When appropriate, all staff members need to identify disrespectful behavior and explain to students why it is disrespectful.
** Consequences
Teachers have agreed that any student who exhibits disrespect to any adult on campus will serve a lunch detention. There will be an initial 2-week implementation where teachers will volunteer to host detention in their classrooms. There will be no clubs during these two weeks since teachers will be hosting detention. Lunch detentions will consist of no more than 5 students per room. While serving a lunch detention, student use of electronic devices is prohibited. Furthermore, students are to complete a /staff apology letter/. This letter will provide students an opportunity to reflect on their behavior. If the letter is not completed, students will be assigned additional detentions until the completion of the letter.
** Scope
In order for this campaign to be successful, it is crucial that our focus remains narrow, and all staff members work to de-escalate situations when possible. Lunch detentions may only be assigned for disrespectful behavior. Behavior outside the scope of disrespect includes, but is not limited to: dress code violations, cell phone use, tardies, missing assignments, or academic infractions. Behavior outside the scope of disrespect must be addressed in another fashion.

If teachers need further support with broader classroom management, Mike Robinson has offered support for implementing CHAMPS.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Recess Restriction*

Teachers may restrict a student's recess time only when they believe that this action is the most effective way to bring about improved behavior. When recess restriction involves the withholding of physical activity from a student, teachers shall try other disciplinary measures before imposing the restriction. Recess restriction shall be subject to the following conditions:

#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment itemize*
#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [noitemsep]
1. The student shall be given adequate time to use the restroom and get a drink or eat lunch, as appropriate.
2. The student shall remain under a certificated employee's supervision during the period of restriction.
3. The student's teacher shall inform the principal of any recess restrictions imposed.
#+END_QUOTE

Helmstedter's interpretation is that we are *not required* to notify parents of a lunchtime detention. However, it is important to involve the parents if we wish to make a difference. +As the monitor teacher, Helmstedter will work with admin to get access and send out the parent email.+ Klopfenstein will send out emails to guardians of all students who receive a lunch detention.

Students who do not show up will attend an after school detention in C-3 on Fridays. This option requires transportation, and a Saturday option for any student who wishes to do that instead of after school. Details are in the works for this process.<2023-03-02 Thu>. Klopfenstein will have a dedicated sheet that includes the students for the Friday after school detentions.

The paper slip shown below (Figure 1) will serve as an initial notification for the student. The white copy is sent to the office, the pink copy is given to the student. After office use, the white copy will be placed in the teacher's box. On the day of the detention, Navarro (or whoever is in the support secretary/attendance position) will go through the spreadsheet and create call slips.

* Long-term Lunch Detention
After the initial two-week period, we will scale back the number of teachers involved in hosting the detentions. This will involve a rotation of teachers who will be compensated. The Friday afternoon detentions will continue for students who are no shows.

** DONE Education Campaign
DEADLINE: <2023-03-16 Thu> SCHEDULED: <2023-03-06 Mon>
Slides were successfully incorporated into homeroom <2023-03-06 Mon> and will continue to be included for the rest of the week. An additional round of slides were created and pushed out in homeroom during the second week as well.
** DONE First Week
SCHEDULED: <2023-03-13 Mon> DEADLINE: <2023-03-17 Fri>
\n
Helmstedter checked in with Admin, cafeteria manager, and host teachers for day one. St. Clare has created an additional document: [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j9XnlOQnEj7ySt8KAybcA0BzBEQ-hDK2YxKmWYnvMLc/edit?usp=sharing][CHAMPS Levels During Detention]] <2023-03-14 Tue>. This is a single slide with CHAMPS expectations

There was a debrief during the staff meeting <2023-03-15 Wed>. Anecdotally, staff mentioned that interactions with students have changed for the better. While addressing areas of improvement, staff agreed to the following. First, when a student is assigned to a host teacher please notify that teacher. Second, we are also trying to be aware of breaking up friend groups in order to manage detention sessions. Hosts may negotiate swapping the rooms in which students serve in order to manage this. Both of these must happen on the day before the detention is served to ensure the call slips and meals are delivered to the correct location.

** DONE Second Week
SCHEDULED: <2023-03-20 Mon> DEADLINE: <2023-03-24 Fri>
The second week came to an end successfully. Notably, there was an increase in no shows. Klopfenstein contacted the parents of all no shows and assigned them after school detention.
** DONE Scale Down Detention
