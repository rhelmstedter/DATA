* Lunch Detention SOP
It is crucial that our focus remains narrow and all staff members work to de-escalate situations when possible. Lunch detentions may only be assigned for disrespectful behavior. Behavior outside the scope of disrespect includes, but is not limited to: dress code violations, cell phone use, tardies, missing assignments, or academic infractions. Behavior outside the scope of disrespect must be addressed in another fashion. Any staff member on campus may assign detentions for disrespectful behavior.
